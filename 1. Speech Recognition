~~User Speaks: The user's speech is captured by the device's microphone.
~Preprocessing: The raw audio is cleaned up:
  Background noise reduction
  Segmentation into manageable chunks
~Speech-to-Text (STT) Engine: A speech recognition model (there are many cloud-based services like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or open-source options) will:
  Analyze the audio signal
  Map sound patterns to phonemes (basic units of sound)
  Generate a text representation of the user's utterance
